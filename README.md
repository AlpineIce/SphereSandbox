# NothingGL
My own personal environment for learning graphics programming; nothing unique to take away from, just my own documentaiton

Not listed in the code here is the GLSL shaders currently being used, or the library dependencies which are: assimp, GLFW, GLEW, glm, and stbimage.

Currently, objects are rendered by placing them in the appropriate folders within the compiled binary with models going into "Models/" and materials (including glsl shader files) going into "Materials/". Textures must be named accordingly to be loaded with materials, with names being Albedo, Roughness, Metallic, and Normal.
